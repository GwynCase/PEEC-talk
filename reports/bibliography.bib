	abstract = {Increasing frequency and severity of wildfire may jeopardize persistence of large tracts of late seral forest, raising concerns over population viability of forest-dependent species like the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). We tracked 20 adult Northern Goshawks with {GPS} loggers over 4 years to investigate roosting (nocturnal) and foraging (diurnal) habitat selection in a heterogeneously burned forest landscape of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, United States. Goshawks selected late seral forest attributes for both roosting and foraging at multiple spatio-temporal scales, although at the finest (daily) scale, goshawks selected more diverse forest structure that included small trees and medium canopy cover. Less than 6\% of roosts were in areas burned in the last 50 years and goshawks avoided areas burned at high severity when roosting and when foraging across spatial scales. Four goshawks (3 males, 1 female) undertook forays {\textgreater}5 km from their nest location, two of which forayed into burned areas during at least one season. High severity fire is likely to make forests unsuitable foraging or roosting habitat for Northern Goshawks, although lower severity fire may provide foraging opportunities for this generalist predator. Eighty percent of foraging space use and 87\% of roost locations were considered high fire hazard potential, suggesting that goshawk habitat in western North America is likely to be reduced by predicted increases in fire frequency and severity in the region.},
