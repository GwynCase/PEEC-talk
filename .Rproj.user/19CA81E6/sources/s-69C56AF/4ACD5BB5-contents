A lot in QGIS, so wanted to document steps. I really wanted to rasterize my VRI data and load it in to R, but this is proving really, really difficult. Apparently rasterization can be done entirely in R, but it's really really slow, so instead I'll try to find a more efficient way to extract polygon data for points in QGIS.

First step is to find all of my roost sites.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load some libraries.
library('tidyverse')
library('lubridate')
library('suncalc')

# Load in telemetry data.
tel.all <- read.csv('../data/processed/h_telem_all.csv', stringsAsFactors=F)

# Pull out the three sites I'm working with.
roam <- tel.all %>%
  filter(site %in% c('SKA', 'RLK', 'MTC')) %>%
  drop_na(lat)

# Do the datetime thing.
roam$date <- ymd(roam$date)
roam$datetime <- ymd_hms(roam$datetime, tz='America/Vancouver')

# Calculate sunrise and sunset times for each day.
roam <- getSunlightTimes(data=roam, keep=c('sunrise', 'sunset'), 
                        tz='America/Vancouver')

# Classify points as daytime or nighttime.
roam <- roam %>%
  mutate(dial=case_when(
    datetime < sunset & datetime > sunrise ~ 'day',
    TRUE ~ 'night'
  ))

# Pull out the nighttime points.
roam.night <- roam %>%
  filter(dial == 'night')

# Save them as a csv.
write.csv()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
