title: "Second model run"
output: html_notebook

Good talk! So my action items are:

* Drop points that are impossible habitat (ie, ranked less than 0 = water)
* Rescale variables.
* Check out some interactions between HSI & other variables.
* Reduce dataset to some lowest common denominator of data.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load some libraries.
library('ggplot2')
library('tidyverse')
library('lme4')

# Read in the points.
points <- read.csv('../data/interim/points.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
