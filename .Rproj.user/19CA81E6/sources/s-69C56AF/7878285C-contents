I have TWO WEEKS to put together a talk for PEEC 2020. Yes, it's only a 3-minute talk but still.

## Plan A

Existing HSI & nest area buffers focus on identifying & protecting NOGO nests (which are important) BUT other behaviours are also important and may not be either predicted or protected by HSI & buffers.

Roosting is one of the other important behaviours. Here I use roosting behaviour to assess whether HSI & buffers are effective at protecting this daily activity.

Also, here are some other things that may do a better job of predicting roosts sites/here is how big a buffer really needs to be to protect roosts.

Outcome One: HSI & buffers are terrible at predicting & protecting roosting sites. Imagine how bad they must be for foraging sites... which will come next.

Outcome Two: HSI & buffers are great at predicting & protecting roosting sites. It remains to be seen whether they will be as good for foraging sites... which will come next.

## Plan B

Animals will reuse places that are important to them and/or are of higher quality. Nests in high-quality habitat should be used more often than nests in low-quality habitats.

Roosting is one kind of habitat that could be reused. Here I use roost sites to examine reuse and return time.

And how does this extend to foraging habitat... future directions.

## Action Items

* Get HSI "heatmap" for nesting model
* Calculate roost site centroids
* Pull land cover variables for each roost site
* Generate random points within 100% MCP
* Pull land cover variables for each random point
* Draw 2-ha buffer around nests
* Measure how well buffers cover roost sites
* Compare used vs. available for variables
* Test predictive power of HSI

## Work in QGIS

### Data prep

To get the land cover variables for each roost site, I loaded a .csv of the roost site centroids (calculated in R) into QGIS. I also loaded a shapefile of VRI polygons.

### Variable extraction

`Toolbox > Add polygon attributes to points > attribute of interest`

Repeat this for each attribute `BCLCS_LV_4`, `BASAL_AREA`, `LIVE STEMS`, `CR_CLOSURE`, `VERT_COMPL`, and `PROJ_AGE_1`

I learned the hard way these two layers have to be in the same projection for this to work, otherwise you get a lot of empty fields. Then:

`Vector > Data Management Tools > Join Attributes by Location`

and clean up duplicate columns. This is very repetitive and there must be a better way to do it.

### Random points

`Vector > Research Tools > Random Points Inside Polygons`

Weirdly, this results in no coordinates, so I had to open go to
`Attribute Table > Field calculator` and create a new field called `xcoord` and populate it with `$x` (and then do the same for the y coord).

Reaching panic state!

### Abstract

**Where the Wild Things Sleep: Incorporating multiple behaviours into habitat models**

Habitat models such as suitability indices and resource selection functions are used in wildlife management to identify critical habitat for protection. The northern goshawk *(Accipiter gentilis)* is a secretive forest raptor associated with mature and old-growth forest In coastal B.C. the goshawk is an at-risk species. Current management efforts focus on protecting forest buffers surrounding goshawks nests with the guidance of a habitat suitability index that models nesting habitat quality. However, other activities besides nesting are crucial for goshawk survival and reproduction, including foraging and roosting. Sheltered nighttime roost sites are important for thermoregulation and have been recommended for inclusion in goshawk management plans elsewhere in North America. Using data from three GPS-tagged goshawks, we examine the effectiveness of the current habitat suitability index for identifying roost sites and consider implications for the identification of foraging habitat.
